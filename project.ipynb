      "In the near future, the unmanned Pilgrim 7 space probe returns from Mars to Earth orbit with soil samples potentially containing evidence of extraterrestrial life. The probe is captured and its samples retrieved by the International Space Station and its six-member crew. Exobiologist Hugh Derry, who is paralyzed from the waist down, revives a dormant cell from the sample, which quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that American school children name \"Calvin\". Hugh realizes that Calvin's cells can change their specialisation, acting as muscle, sensor, and neuron cells all at once.\n",
      "An accident in the lab causes Calvin to become dormant; Hugh attempts to revive Calvin with electric shocks, but Calvin immediately becomes hostile and attacks Hugh, crushing his hand. While Hugh lies unconscious from Calvin's attack, Calvin uses Hugh's electric shock tool to escape its enclosure; now free in the laboratory, Calvin devours a lab rat by absorbing it, growing in size. Engineer Rory Adams enters the lab to rescue Hugh; he is locked in by fellow crew member and physician David Jordan, however, to keep Calvin contained. Calvin latches onto Rory's leg; after Rory unsuccessfully attacks Calvin with a portable rocket thruster, Calvin enters his mouth, devouring his organs from the inside and killing him. Emerging from Rory's mouth even larger, Calvin escapes through a fire-control vent.\n",
      "Finding their communication with Earth cut off due to overheating of the communication systems, ISS commander Ekaterina Golovkina performs a space walk to find and fix the problem. She discovers that Calvin has breached the ISS's cooling system; soon after, Calvin attacks her, rupturing her spacesuit's water coolant system in the process and causing the water in the system to fill her suit. She blindly makes her way back to the airlock; however, she and the crew realize that if she re-enters, Calvin will also be able to re-enter the ISS. Hence, she refuses to open the hatch and stops David from helping her do so; this keeps Calvin out of the station for the time being but also causes her to drown and die in her spacesuit.\n",
      "Calvin then attempts to re-enter the station through its maneuvering thrusters. The crew try to fire the thrusters to blast Calvin away from the spacecraft, but their attempts fail, using up too much fuel and causing the ISS to enter a decaying orbit where it will burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Pilot Sho Murakami informs the crew that they need to use the station's remaining fuel to get back into a safe orbit, although this allows Calvin to re-enter the station. The crew plan to make Calvin dormant by sealing themselves into one module and venting the atmosphere from the rest of the station.\n",
      "After the remaining crew finalize preparations to do so, Hugh enters cardiac arrest. The crew then discover that Calvin has been feeding off of Hugh's paralyzed leg. Calvin attacks the remainder of the crew; Sho seals himself in a sleeping pod. As Calvin attempts to break its glass, David and the quarantine officer Miranda North use Hugh's corpse as bait to lure Calvin away from Sho and trap it in another module to deprive it of oxygen. Having received a distress call prior to the damage to the ISS's communication system, Earth sends a Soyuz spacecraft to the station as a fail-safe plan to push the station into deep space. Believing the Soyuz to be on a rescue mission for the ISS crew, Sho leaves his pod and moves to board it, forcing open its hatch; Calvin then attacks him and the Soyuz crew, causing the craft's docking mechanism to fail and resulting in the capsule crashing into the ISS, killing Sho and the Soyuz crew and causing the ISS to once again enter a decaying orbit.\n",
      "The only two remaining survivors, David and Miranda, aware that Calvin could survive re-entry, plan for David to lure Calvin into one of the two remaining escape pods attached to the ISS for David to manually pilot the pod into deep space, isolating Calvin and allowing Miranda to return to Earth in the second pod. David manages to lure Calvin into his pod while Miranda enters her pod; as they simultaneously undock their pods from the ISS, one of the pods hits debris and is damaged, veering off course. In David's pod, Calvin attacks him as he struggles to manually pilot the pod; in Miranda's pod, she records a black box message in case of her death during re-entry informing the world of her colleagues' deaths and not to trust Calvin nor any extraterrestrial life from Mars as well as to destroy Calvin at any cost should he make his way to Earth.\n",
      "The two pods separate, one earthbound, the other spiraling away from Earth. The earthbound pod lands in the ocean; two nearby Vietnamese fishermen approach it. As they look into the pod, it is revealed to be David's, the astronaut now encased in a web-like substance. Meanwhile, Miranda's pod's navigation system fails due to damage sustained from the debris, sending her flying away from Earth out of control, much to her horror. On Earth, despite David attempting to warn the fishermen, the fishermen open the pod's hatch. Meanwhile, more boats arrive.\n",

      "Waking inside a laboratory on an airship, a man recalls bullies from his childhood. A scientist, Estelle (Haley Bennett), greets him and says his name is Henry, she is his wife, and that he has been revived from an accident that left him amnesiac and mute. After she replaces a missing arm and leg with cybernetic prostheses, mercenaries led by the psychokinetic Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) raid the ship, claiming all of Estelle's research is Akan's corporate property. He kills Estelle's scientists before attempting to murder Henry, but Henry and Estelle flee in an escape pod, landing in Moscow. Estelle is abducted by the mercenaries, who try to kill Henry.\n",
      "Henry is rescued by a mysterious man, Jimmy (Sharlto Copley), who informs him that his cybernetic implants are running out of power, which will kill him if he can't recharge. Jimmy is killed by corrupt cops bought out by Akan, and Henry is forced to fight his way through both cops and mercenaries, sneaking onto a bus. He is joined by Jimmy — not dead, now an alcoholic, odorous bum — who informs him that one of Akan's associates, Slick Dimitry, has a cybernetic charging pump implanted, which Henry needs to recharge. The two are attacked by a flamethrower-wielding goon. Jimmy is incinerated, but Henry escapes, locating and chasing Dimitry throughout Moscow before capturing him; just as Dimitry promises him information, he is killed by a sniper. Henry removes the pump and receives a call from Jimmy, who directs Henry to a brothel.\n",
      "Henry meets two more versions of Jimmy — a cocaine-addicted lothario and a shy, awkward geek — who replace his pump. The brothel is attacked by Akan's forces. Henry fights his way through, but encounters Akan, who taunts him with Estelle's kidnapping, revealing she is being transported by an armored convoy. Akan hurls Henry out of the brothel.\n",
      "Outside, Henry encounters another Jimmy — now a marijuana-obsessed hippie-biker — who transports him to Akan's convoy. Henry finds Estelle - and Akan, who (seemingly) kills him and buries him in the woods.\n",
      "Jimmy finds and resuscitates Henry, only to be shelled by a tank. After killing the tank crew, fending off a helicopter, and failing to ride a runaway horse, Henry finds another Jimmy — a gruff sniper in a ghillie suit — who leads him to an abandoned hotel, where Jimmy is headquartered in a hidden laboratory. Jimmy and Henry encounter a number of policemen surrounding a girl. They are in the process of forcing her to perform oral sex on one of the cops. Henry kills them all. Here, the real Jimmy — a quadriplegic scientist — reveals his motive for helping Henry: revenge against Akan, who crippled him after his own cyborg super-soldiers failed. He reveals the other Jimmys are dormant clones that he can control, through which he lives a vice-filled life. The clones attack Henry after Jimmy realizes that Henry has been unknowingly broadcasting his location to Akan, with a strike force closing in. Fending off Jimmy, Henry convinces him to help. Henry and the clones of Jimmy — ranging from a punk rocker to a posh WWII Colonel — fight their way out, killing the force by collapsing the laboratory on them.\n",
      "Jimmy and Henry drive to Akan's headquarters. They fight their way into an elevator, but Jimmy is mortally wounded. Before dying, Jimmy thanks Henry for being the closest thing to a friend he had, and removes a memory blocker, gradually restoring Henry's memories. Henry fights his way to the highest floor, where he is greeted by Akan, revealing an army of cyborg super-soldiers being fed Henry's memories. One such soldier fights Henry, followed by the rest of the army, chasing Henry to the roof.\n",
      "Henry wipes out the entire army. Akan arrives and severely wounds Henry. Shortly after, Estelle arrives as well. In reality, Estelle was Akan's wife, forming an elaborate ruse to field-test Henry and use his memories to manipulate cyborg soldiers into doing anything to \"rescue\" their \"wife\" — specifically, terrorist attacks and world domination as Akan's loyal slaves. The two leave Henry for dead, leaving in a helicopter. Henry blacks out, but is energized by an emerging memory of his father (Tim Roth) encouraging him to fight back against the childhood bullies seen in the intro. Henry manages to reach Akan, decapitating him with his cybernetic eyestalk. He jumps onto Estelle's helicopter, presenting her Akan's head. Estelle shoots him, but the bullet ricochets off his cybernetic hand and wounds her, leaving her hanging from the helicopter. Estelle pleads with Henry to save her, but Henry slams the door, sending her falling to her death.\n",

      "In 2049, replicants (described as \"bioengineered humans\") are slaves. K, a replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as a \"Blade Runner\", an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicants. At a protein farm, he retires Sapper Morton and finds a box buried under a tree. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a caesarean section, demonstrating that replicants can reproduce sexually, previously thought impossible. K's superior, Lieutenant Joshi, is fearful that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth.\n",
      "K visits the Wallace Corporation headquarters (the successor-in-interest in the manufacturing of replicants to the Tyrell Corporation, which went out of business) where the deceased female is identified from DNA archives as Rachael, an experimental replicant designed by Dr. Tyrell. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner Rick Deckard. Wallace CEO Niander Wallace wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar colonization. He sends his replicant enforcer Luv to steal Rachael's remains from LAPD headquarters and follow K to Rachael's child.\n",
      "At Morton's farm, K sees the date 6-10-21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicants' memories are artificial, K's holographic AI girlfriend Joi believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. K burns down the farm and leaves. He searches the LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the sex chromosome but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined San Diego, but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it.\n",
      "Dr. Ana Stelline, a designer of replicant memories, confirms that his memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to disappear. At Joi's request, K transfers her to a mobile emitter, an emanator. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of Las Vegas. He finds Deckard, who reveals that he is the father of Rachael's child and that he scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement.\n",
      "After killing Joshi, Luv tracks K to Deckard's hiding place in Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi and leaves K to die. The replicant freedom movement rescues K. Their leader Freysa informs him that Rachael's child is female and he is not Rachael's son. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to the child or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for the greater good of all replicants.\n",
      "Luv brings Deckard to Wallace Co. headquarters to meet Niander Wallace. He offers Deckard a clone of Rachael for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses and Luv kills the clone. As Luv is transporting Deckard to a ship to take him off-world to be interrogated, K intercepts and kills Luv but is severely injured in the fight. He stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the rogue replicants and leads Deckard to Stelline's office, having deduced that she is his daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers. As Deckard reunites with Stelline, K dies peacefully from his wounds.\n"
